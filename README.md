# MN COVID-19 Model Sandbox
## Purpose
This web app aims to provide a no-code web app interface to the University of Minnesota's COVID-19 Model (https://github.com/MN-COVID19-Model/Model_v3), allowing use of the model without downloading R. 

## Audience
This tool is intended to be used by academic researchers, decision-makers, and the general public.

**EXTREMELY IMPORTANT: Before using this tool, it is essential that you understand the design, assumptions, and limitations of the underlying epidemiological modeling: https://mn.gov/covid19/data/modeling/**
